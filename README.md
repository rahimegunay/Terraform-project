# What is Terraform
Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool, enables secure and efficient resource provisioning. It achieves this by utilizing human-readable configuration files that are versionable, reusable, and shareable. Terraform's functionality revolves around creating and overseeing resources on various cloud platforms and services by interacting with their APIs. It empowers developers to design and deploy a dependable, replicable, and consistent infrastructure.

The Terraform Configuration Language, also known as HashiCorp's Configuration Language (HCL), is employed for specifying resources that represent infrastructure components. These configuration files inform Terraform about the plugins to install, the infrastructure to establish, and the data to retrieve.
